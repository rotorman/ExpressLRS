### PERFORMANCE OPTIONS: ###

-DLOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION

# For TX devices with fans, FAN_MIN_RUNTIME keeps the fan running even after the power level has
# dropped below the configured Fan Threshold. This prevents the fan from turning on and off every
# few seconds if the power level is constantly changing.
# Default is 30 seconds if not defined, value can be 0-254.
#-DFAN_MIN_RUNTIME=30

### COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS: ###

#-DTLM_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS=240LU

### OTHER OPTIONS: ###

#-DHOME_WIFI_PASSWORD=""


### Debugging options ###

# For an ESP32S3 MCU, there are two options:
# 1 - Pull-up on GPIO3, USB for JTAG (on MI_02), debug logging uses main UART.
# 2 - Pull-down on GPIO3, Individual pins for JTAG (MTDI/MTMS/MTCK/MTDO), debug logging via USB for CDC UART (on MI_00)
